# Aspects correctly implemented:
# 1. Managed to get webpages up and running
# 2. Included anchor links to resume and bio within index, using relative URLs
# 3. Included image in index
# 4. Used at least 5 rules in CSS file

# Aspects I did not successfully implement:
# 1. Did not manage to center image (Why?)
# 2. Imageheading rule in CSS stylesheet did not work (Why?)

# Challenges faced:
# 1. Accidentally added files into wrong repo, and struggled to use git to correct that mistake
# 2. Had some trouble trying to edit styling to help center image
# 3. Took some time to find the right font sizes
# 4. Initially repeated id="---" for the tags e.g. <p class="bio">, but I got errors that said duplicate. (Why? Do you only need to declare the id once, and it works for any tags under it afterwards?
